📘 Pattern-Wise DSA Practice Questions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Sliding Window Pattern

Used for substring/array problems where we check contiguous ranges.

Problems:

Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

Minimum Window Substring

Find All Anagrams in a String

Permutation in String (Check if s2 contains permutation of s1)

Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Subarrays with K Different Integers


=====================================================
Smallest Subarray with Sum ≥ K

How to Solve (Idea):

Use a sliding window:

Start with two pointers: l (left) and r (right) at start of array.

Expand r and add nums[r] to current sum.

If sum ≥ target → try shrinking window from l to minimize length.

Keep track of the smallest length during this process.

Time complexity: O(n) because each element is visited at most twice (once by r, once by l).

=====================================================

Max Consecutive Ones (with at most K flips)

✅ Approach — Sliding Window

This is a classic sliding window problem.

🧠 Logic:

Keep a window [left, right].

Count how many zeros are inside the window.

If zeros > K → move left pointer until zeros ≤ K again.

Track the maximum window size.
