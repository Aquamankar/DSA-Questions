kafka topics wise study and revision 


 Kafka Basics & Architecture
What is Kafka and when to use it

Kafka vs traditional message brokers (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)

Kafka components:

Producer

Consumer

Topic

Partition

Broker

Cluster

Zookeeper (older) / KRaft (newer)

Log-based storage concept

Pull vs Push in Kafka

2. Topics & Partitions
Topic creation and naming conventions

Partitions for scalability

Partition leader and replicas

Replication factor

How Kafka ensures fault tolerance

How consumers know which partition to read from

3. Producers
Producer API basics

Producer acknowledgments (acks=0, 1, all)

Message keys and partitioning strategy

Batching and compression (gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd)

Idempotent producers

Producer retries and delivery guarantees

4. Consumers & Consumer Groups
Consumer API basics

Consumer group concept

Offset management (auto vs manual commit)

Rebalance events and how they work

Consumer lag

Poll mechanism (poll() method)

Static vs dynamic group membership

5. Kafka Message Delivery Semantics
At-most-once

At-least-once

Exactly-once semantics (EOS)

How Kafka achieves each

6. Kafka Storage & Retention
Log segment files

Retention policies:

Time-based retention

Size-based retention

Log compaction

How Kafka handles old messages

7. Kafka Streams & KSQL
Kafka Streams API

Stateless vs stateful processing

Windowing in streams

KSQL basics for streaming queries

8. Kafka Connect
Source connectors (e.g., MySQL → Kafka)

Sink connectors (e.g., Kafka → Elasticsearch)

Standalone vs distributed mode

Common connectors and configs

9. Kafka Security
Authentication (SASL, Kerberos, SSL)

Authorization (ACLs)

Encryption in-transit (TLS)

10. Kafka in Production
Monitoring metrics (through JMX, Prometheus)

Common operational issues:

High consumer lag

Under-replicated partitions

Leader imbalance

Scaling Kafka clusters

Backup & disaster recovery

Schema management with Confluent Schema Registry (Avro, JSON, Protobuf)

✅ Common Kafka Interview Questions

Explain Kafka’s architecture in detail.

How does Kafka achieve fault tolerance?

How do you ensure exactly-once message processing?

What is consumer lag and how do you reduce it?

How does partitioning affect message ordering?

How do you secure a Kafka cluster?

If you want, I can prepare you a Kafka Interview Quick Revision Sheet with 50+ questions and short bullet answers, so you can go through them like flashcards before an interview. That format works really well for last-minute prep.
