String string map find higest price nth 


ChatGPT said:
Great! You're asking for a Java program that uses a Map<String, String> (e.g., product name â†’ price) and finds:

The highest price

The Nth highest price

Letâ€™s break it down with an example and complete code.

âœ… Input Example
java
Copy code
Map<String, String> productMap = new HashMap<>();
productMap.put("Phone", "16000.0");
productMap.put("Tablet", "6000.0");
productMap.put("Laptop", "150000.0");
productMap.put("Headphones", "3000.0");
productMap.put("Camera", "50000.0");
âœ… Java Code: Find Nth Highest Price
java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> productMap = new HashMap<>();
        productMap.put("Phone", "16000.0");
        productMap.put("Tablet", "6000.0");
        productMap.put("Laptop", "150000.0");
        productMap.put("Headphones", "3000.0");
        productMap.put("Camera", "50000.0");

        int n = 2; // Change this to get Nth highest price

        Optional<Double> nthHighest = productMap.values().stream()
                .map(Double::parseDouble)
                .distinct()
                .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                .skip(n - 1)
                .findFirst();

        if (nthHighest.isPresent()) {
            double price = nthHighest.get();
            System.out.println(n + "th highest price: " + price);

            // Also print product(s) with this price
            List<String> products = productMap.entrySet().stream()
                    .filter(entry -> Double.parseDouble(entry.getValue()) == price)
                    .map(Map.Entry::getKey)
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

            System.out.println("Product(s) with " + n + "th highest price: " + products);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not enough unique prices to find " + n + "th highest.");
        }
    }
}
âœ… Output (when n = 2)
yaml
Copy code
2th highest price: 50000.0
Product(s) with 2th highest price: [Camera]
âœ… Notes:
Prices are in String, so we convert them to Double.

Used .distinct() to avoid duplicate prices.

You can change n = 1
