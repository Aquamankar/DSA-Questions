Array Questions (In-Place)

Reverse an array

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Approach: Use two pointers (i=0, j=n-1) and swap elements until i<j.

Find duplicate in an array (1 to n)

Input: [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]

Output: 3

Approach: Use index marking (negate the value at index abs(arr[i]) - 1). If already negative, that number is duplicate.

Remove duplicates from sorted array

Input: [1,1,2,2,3,4,4]

Output: [1,2,3,4] (in-place, return new length)

Approach: Two pointer method (slow and fast).

Move zeros to the end

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]

Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Approach: Use two pointers to shift non-zero elements forward.

Find missing number (1 to n)

Input: [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Approach: Use XOR or sum formula (n*(n+1))/2.

Rotate array by k

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k=3

Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Approach: Reverse full array, then reverse first k and last n-k.

Check if array is sorted and rotated

Input: [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: true

Approach: Count number of "drops" (where arr[i] > arr[i+1]). If more than 1, return false.

🔹 Map / Frequency-Based Questions (But without extra DS)

Since you can’t use HashMap, here are tricks:

Find frequency of elements (range: 1 to n only)

Modify array by using index as a counter:

arr[arr[i] % n] += n;


Finally, arr[i]/n gives frequency.

Find majority element (> n/2 times)

Use Moore’s Voting Algorithm (O(1) space).

Check if two arrays are equal (without HashMap)

Sort both arrays and compare element by element.

Find first repeating element

Use index marking (negating like in duplicate detection).

Find missing and repeating element (1 to n)

Use XOR or math formula (sum of n natural numbers – actual sum) and (sum of squares) to derive missing and repeating.

✅ These questions are basic but cover array + map logic.
✅ All are in-place, without extra space.
✅ Common in FAANG-style DSA interviews for freshers/juniors.

Do you want me to write Java code implementations for each of these (step-by-step), or just a short trick explanation for interviews?

Great choice 👍
Let’s solve Find Missing Number (1 to n) without using extra space.

Problem

Given an array of size n containing numbers from 0 to n (or 1 to n), one number is missing. Find the missing number.

Example

Input:

arr = [3, 0, 1]


Output:

2

Approaches
✅ 1. Sum Formula

Expected sum = n*(n+1)/2

Actual sum = sum of array elements

Missing = Expected – Actual

public class MissingNumber {
    public static int findMissing(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int expected = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actual = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            actual += num;
        }
        return expected - actual;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 0, 1};
        System.out.println(findMissing(arr)); // 2
    }
}


⏱ Time: O(n)
📦 Space: O(1)

✅ 2. XOR Method (No Overflow Risk)

XOR of all numbers from 0 to n

XOR of all elements in array

Missing = XOR of both

public class MissingNumberXOR {
    public static int findMissing(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int xor1 = 0, xor2 = 0;

        // XOR with numbers from 0..n
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            xor1 ^= i;
        }

        // XOR with array elements
        for (int num : nums) {
            xor2 ^= num;
        }

        return xor1 ^ xor2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 0, 1};
        System.out.println(findMissing(arr)); // 2
    }
}
