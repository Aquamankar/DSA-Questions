📌 Kubernetes Topics for Interview Prep
1. Kubernetes Basics

What is Kubernetes? Why do we use it?

Difference between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.

Core components: Pod, Node, Deployment, ReplicaSet, Service.

Control Plane vs Worker Node.

kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, etcd, kubelet, kube-proxy.

2. Pods and Workloads

What is a Pod? Can a Pod run multiple containers?

Difference between Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob.

Rolling updates vs Recreate deployment strategy.

How to scale applications in Kubernetes.

3. Services & Networking

ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName services.

Difference between Ingress and LoadBalancer.

CNI (Container Network Interface) and common plugins (Flannel, Calico, Cilium).

DNS in Kubernetes (CoreDNS).

How service discovery works in Kubernetes.

4. Storage & Config

PersistentVolume (PV) vs PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

StorageClass and dynamic provisioning.

ConfigMap vs Secret.

How Kubernetes handles environment variables.

5. Security & RBAC

Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding.

Service accounts and how they differ from user accounts.

Network Policies.

Pod Security Standards (baseline, restricted).

6. Scheduling & Resource Management

How does the Kubernetes scheduler decide where to place a Pod?

NodeSelector, Affinity, Taints and Tolerations.

Resource requests and limits (CPU, memory).

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA).

Pod Disruption Budgets.

7. Monitoring & Logging

How do you monitor Kubernetes?

Prometheus, Grafana, EFK/ELK stack.

LivenessProbe, ReadinessProbe, StartupProbe.

8. Helm & Operators

What is Helm? Helm chart basics.

Difference between Helm and Kustomize.

Operators – what they are and when to use them.

9. CI/CD & Kubernetes

How Kubernetes fits into CI/CD pipelines.

Rolling updates vs Blue-Green vs Canary deployments.

10. Advanced Concepts

ETCD – what does it store?

Kubernetes namespaces and resource quotas.

API Gateway vs Ingress.

Difference between StatefulSet and Deployment.

How Kubernetes achieves high availability.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a cheat sheet PDF with diagrams + short definitions + most asked interview Q&A for Kubernetes (like we did for Hibernate/SQL/Java)? That way you can keep it handy for quick revision before interviews.
